A genetic algorithm simulation studying trade-offs between bacterial growth rates and lag phases under fluctuating resource conditions. Inspired by Lenski's long-term evolution experiment.

## üìå Overview

This project implements:
- Consumer-resource ODE models with alternating substrates
- Tournament selection genetic algorithm
- Mutation rate comparison across 5 parameters
- Experimental replication with statistical analysis
- Automated visualization of evolutionary trajectories

## üß¨ Key Features
- **Biologically Realistic Modeling**
  - Logistic growth with lag phase adaptation
  - Resource-dependent fitness landscapes
  - Trade-off constrained parameter space
- **Evolutionary Framework**
  - Configurable mutation rates (0.01-0.1)
  - Tournament selection with size control
  - Index-based mutation preserving trait correlations
- **Analysis Tools**
  - Multi-experiment averaging
  - Generation-by-generation parameter tracking
  - Comparative fitness visualization
